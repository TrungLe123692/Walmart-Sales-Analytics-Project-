## 1. Business Objective
* Analyze sales to find **top vs underperforming product lines**.
* Uncover **trends by hour, weekday, and month** to guide staffing and promos.
* Understand **customer behavior** by type, payment, and gender.
* Compare **branch performance** to reveal regional strengths and gaps.
* Evaluate **profitability** with revenue, VAT, gross margin, and gross income.

## 3. ETL Structure

> âœ… This projectâ€™s ETL process extracted Walmart sales data from Kaggle, cleaned and transformed it with feature engineering and metric calculations in MySQL, then loaded it into a production table for analysis and dashboarding.

### 3.1 Extract
* **Source**
  â–ª Kaggle Walmart Sales CSV, three branches: Mandalay, Yangon, Naypyitaw  
  â–ª Single flat file with 1,000 rows and 17 columns
* **Ingestion**
  â–ª Manual download or scripted pull  
  â–ª Staged to `/data/walmart_sales.csv`
* **Landing â†’ Staging**
  â–ª Load into MySQL staging schema for validation
* **Data Validation (Extract)**
  â–ª File integrity check (row count, column count)  
  â–ª Schema conformity check (headers, types)  

```sql
-- Create database and staging table
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS walmartSales;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS staging_sales (
  invoice_id VARCHAR(30),
  branch VARCHAR(5),
  city VARCHAR(30),
  customer_type VARCHAR(30),
  gender VARCHAR(30),
  product_line VARCHAR(100),
  unit_price DECIMAL(10,2),
  quantity INT,
  tax_pct FLOAT(6,4),
  total DECIMAL(12,4),
  date DATETIME,
  time TIME,
  payment VARCHAR(15),
  cogs DECIMAL(10,2),
  gross_margin_pct FLOAT(11,9),
  gross_income DECIMAL(12,4),
  rating FLOAT(2,1)
);
```

---

### 3.2 Transform
* **Cleaning**
  â–ª Trim, uppercase or title-case categorical fields (`branch`, `city`, `product_line`, `payment`)  
  â–ª Enforce NOT NULL business-critical columns (invoice, date, product, price, quantity)  
  â–ª Remove exact duplicates on `invoice_id, product_line, unit_price, quantity`
* **Type Casting**
  â–ª Cast numerics: `unit_price`, `quantity`, `tax_pct`, `total`, `cogs`, `gross_income`  
  â–ª Ensure `date` as `DATETIME`, `time` as `TIME`
* **Feature Engineering**
  â–ª `time_of_day` = Morning, Afternoon, Evening  
  â–ª `day_name` = DAYNAME(`date`)  
  â–ª `month_name` = MONTHNAME(`date`)
* **Business Metrics (row-level)**
  â–ª `cogs` = `unit_price` Ã— `quantity`  
  â–ª `vat_amount` = 0.05 Ã— `cogs`  
  â–ª `gross_sales` = `cogs` + `vat_amount`  
  â–ª `gross_income` = `gross_sales` âˆ’ `cogs`  
  â–ª `gross_margin_pct` = `gross_income` / `gross_sales`
* **Data Validation (Transform)**
  â–ª Non-negative checks on `unit_price`, `quantity`, `cogs`, `total`  
  â–ª Referential checks on controlled vocabularies (branch A, B, C; known product lines; payment methods)

## 5. SQL Script 

> âœ… The SQL script builds a clean sales table, engineers time-based and categorical features, and answers business questions on products, customers, and sales trends using aggregations, filtering, and grouping.

- **5.1 Setup, Schema, and Initial Checks**
   - Created `walmartSales` database.  
   - Defined `sales` table with strict types, `NOT NULL` constraints, and `PRIMARY KEY` on `invoice_id`.  
   - Added columns for product, customer, financial, and time data.  
```sql
-- Create database
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS walmartSales;

-- Create table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS sales (
  invoice_id VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  branch VARCHAR(5) NOT NULL,
  city VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
  customer_type VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
  gender VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
  product_line VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  unit_price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  quantity INT NOT NULL,
  tax_pct FLOAT(6,4) NOT NULL,
  total DECIMAL(12, 4) NOT NULL,
  date DATETIME NOT NULL,
  time_of_day TIME NOT NULL,
  payment VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,
  cogs DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  gross_margin_pct FLOAT(11,9),
  gross_income DECIMAL(12, 4),
  rating FLOAT(2, 1)
);

-- Data cleaning check
SELECT * FROM salesdatawalmart.sales;
```

- **5.2 Feature Engineering, Time Dimensions**
   - Categorized purchase `time` into Morning, Afternoon, or Evening using `CASE`.  
   - Added `time_of_day` column to store these categories.  
   - Extracted day of week with `DAYNAME()` into new `day_name` column.  
   - Extracted month name with `MONTHNAME()` into new `month_name` column.  
```sql
-- Categorize purchase time into Morning/Afternoon/Evening
SELECT
  time,
  (CASE
     WHEN `time` BETWEEN "00:00:00" AND "12:00:00" THEN "Morning"
     WHEN `time` BETWEEN "12:01:00" AND "16:00:00" THEN "Afternoon"
     ELSE "Evening"
   END) AS time_of_day
FROM salesdatawalmart.sales;

ALTER TABLE sales ADD COLUMN time_of_day VARCHAR(20);

-- Note, this updates `time` with labels; typically you'd update `time_of_day`
UPDATE salesdatawalmart.sales
SET time = (
  CASE
    WHEN `time` BETWEEN "00:00:00" AND "12:00:00" THEN "Morning"
    WHEN `time` BETWEEN "12:01:00" AND "16:00:00" THEN "Afternoon"
    ELSE "Evening"
  END
);

-- Day of week
SELECT date, DAYNAME(date) FROM salesdatawalmart.sales;
ALTER TABLE salesdatawalmart.sales ADD COLUMN day_name VARCHAR(10);
UPDATE salesdatawalmart.sales SET day_name = DAYNAME(date);

-- Month name
SELECT date, MONTHNAME(date) FROM salesdatawalmart.sales;
ALTER TABLE salesdatawalmart.sales ADD COLUMN month_name VARCHAR(10);
UPDATE salesdatawalmart.sales SET month_name = MONTHNAME(date);
